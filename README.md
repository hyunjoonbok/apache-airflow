## Airflow

These examples display unique functionality available in Amazon SageMaker. They cover a broad range of topics with different method that user can utilize inside SageMaker.

   #### [Image Classification on CIFAR-10 (transfer-learning)](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/amazon-sagemaker/blob/master/Image%20Classification%20on%20CIFAR-10%20(transfer-learning)%20in%20Amazon%20SageMaker.ipynb) 
   <p>
    We use transfer learning mode in Sagemaker to fine-tune a pre-trained model (trained on imagenet data) to learn to classify a new dataset. The pre-trained model (ImageNet) will be fine-tuned using CIFAR-10 dataset. This covers a complete model-building cycle (dataloading, preprocessing, Hyperparmeter setting, Sagemaker training, Investigating loss, Testing, Model Deployment) using Amazon SageMaker.
